# fpm-example-3: Base Styles

A foundational bundle providing CSS variables and reset styles.

## Contents

- `styles/variables.css` - CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, typography)
- `styles/reset.css` - CSS reset for consistent cross-browser styling

## Usage

Other bundles can depend on this to get consistent design tokens.

## Version Tracking

The `version` field in `bundle.toml` is used by fpm integration tests to verify push functionality. It gets incremented automatically during test runs.

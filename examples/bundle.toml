# This file defines the bundles to be fetched by fpm

# Required: The fpm version that created this manifest
fpm_version = "0.1.0"

# Required: Identifier marking this as a fpm bundle file
identifier = "fpm-bundle"

# Optional: Description of what this bundle is about
description = "Example bundle configuration for demonstration purposes"

# Optional: Root directory where artifacts are stored (relative to this file)
# If present, this bundle can be published. If absent, it's a consuming-only bundle.
# root = "artifacts"

# Bundle dependencies
# Each bundle is fetched from its git repository and placed in .fpm/<bundle-name>

[bundles.example-assets]
version = "1.0.0"
git = "https://github.com/example/assets.git"
# Optional: subdirectory within the repository
# path = "public/assets"
# Optional: branch to fetch (defaults to "main")

# Example with include filter to select specific directories/files
# [bundles.filtered-bundle]
# version = "1.0.0"
# git = "https://github.com/example/large-repo.git"
# include = ["folder2", "folder3", "specific-file.txt"]
# When include is specified, only the listed paths will be copied from the bundle.
# If not specified, all files and directories are included (default behavior).
